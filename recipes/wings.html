	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>The rice flour coating on these wings turned out to be light, crispy, and extremely sauce friendly.</p>
	<p>You can spice the flour any way you want!</p>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1 pound chicken wing sections (flats and drums)</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
		<li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
		<li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
		<li>½ cup stone-ground rice flour</li>
		<li>2 cups vegetable oil for frying, or as needed</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Steps</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Place split chicken wings into a mixing bowl. Sprinkle with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Toss to evenly coat pieces. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
		<li>Place rice flour in a shallow dish. Dredge chicken wing pieces in small batches in the flour and transfer to a plate. Arrange pieces so there is some space between them; allow wings to sit out for 15 minutes before frying.</li>
		<li>Line a baking sheet with paper towels; place a draining rack on the towels.</li>
		<li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Transfer wings to oil; fry until inside is crispy and golden brown and chicken is cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
		<li>Remove wings from oil with a slotted spoon and drain on a rack placed over paper towels.</li>
	</ol>
